# ECE
A database for the Electrical and Computer Engineering's robotics club
To get this to work, you need to create a new database using the ECEonequery file in SQL. After that, you go to App.config and modify the connection string to match the name and server of your database. It should work after that, if not I am available to help at ijk22701@gmail.com.
